# NOTE: Avoid setting a global build target here.
# It breaks macOS/Linux CI by forcing the Windows MSVC target.
# If you need MSVC on Windows, prefer a repo-local override:
#   rustup override set stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
# Or use a one-off command:
#   cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc run
